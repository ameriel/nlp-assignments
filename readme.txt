Natural Language Processing Assignments

Assignments completed as part of a university Natural Language Processing class. Each assignment was done as part of a pair with another student.

Minimum edit distance: given two words, finds the minimum edit distance between them (counting replacements as two operations) and displays the operations needed to make the edit.

Part of speech tagging: given a training file and a testing file, the program will run statistical analysis on the training text and use this to tag the part of speech of each word in the testing text. Displays results about its accuracy.

Simple tokenizer: separates the text in nc.txt into words and reports some statistics about the contents.

Spam classifier: Runs statistical analysis on the training texts and attempts to classify the testing texts as being either spam messages or legitimate messages. Displays results about its accuracy.
